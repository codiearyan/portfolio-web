    "Full Stack Developer crafting fast, polished experiences. Founding Engineer at Wagr Games, building real-time gaming products across web, iOS, and Android.",
  summary:
    "I'm a full stack developer who loves taking products from idea to production: scalable backends, snappy frontends, and the design details in between. Since **January 2025** I've been a **Founding Engineer at Wagr Games**, building gaming experiences for web, iOS, and Android. Before that I interned at **Kidjig**, shipping AI applications and tools end to end. Outside of work you'll find me building side projects and exploring new tools.",
